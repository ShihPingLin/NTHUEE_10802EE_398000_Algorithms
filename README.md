### Brief Introduction
This responsitory contains all homework of NTHUEE Algorithms course. The purpose of uploading these homework is to record what I have learned from this course. **Any form of cheating, lying, or plagiarism will not be tolerated by professor.** Last but not least, I want to express my sincere gratitude for all the efforts Prof. Chang, Mi-Chang have taken during those days. You are really an earnest and hard-working teacher.

- ./hw01\
  In this homework, I will implement four sorting algorithms, analyze and compare their performance. The four sorting algorithms are selection sort, insertion sort, bubble sort,    and shaker sort.
  
- ./hw02\
  In this homework, I will implement three kinds of primitive searching algorithms: linear search, bidirection search, random-direction search. Besides, I will compare the performance between three kinds of algorithms and explain the reasons.
  
- ./hw03\
  In this report, I will implement the heap sort algorithm, then comparing with four kinds of quadratic sorting algorithms in homework 1: selection sort, insertion sort, bubble sort, and shaker sort.

- ./hw04\
  The connectivity problem is to determine if two given nodes in the network are connected or not. In this report, I will implement a general algorithm to solve this problem.

- ./hw05\
  The purpose of this report is to find the maximum earning for one-buy-one-sell stock trading. I will find the buying day and the price, the selling day and the price, and the
maximum earning made per share using two kinds of maximum subarray algorithms, BruteForce Approach and Divide and Conquer Approach.

- ./hw06\
   We have already solved the single-buy-single-sell stock trading problem in Homework 5. However, Brute-Force Approach in Homework 5 is inefficiency, which possesses a time complexity of O(n3). Thus, this homework is intended to fix the problem.

- ./hw07\
  In this report, I will design an algorithm to divide a group of N people into friend subgroups.

- ./hw08\
  In this homework, I will design an algorithm to help a student selecting courses to maximize his learning.

- ./hw09\
  The goal of this homework is to construct the Huffman code corresponding to each given text file and show the ratio between the Huffman encoded storage and the standard ASCII
storage.

- ./hw10\
  In this homework, I will write a function to calculate gn(D) using dynamic programming approach, and using this function to answer following questions:
  - Given {C1, C2, C3, C4} = {1, 5, 10, 50}, find the average number of coins for D = 1 to 99.
  - Assuming C4 is a variable, find its value that minimizes the average for D = 1 to 99. 
  - Assuming C3 is a variable, find its value that minimizes the average for D = 1 to 99.
  - Assuming both C3 and C4 are variables, find their values that minimizes the average for D = 1 to 99.

- ./hw11\
  Given two similar text files, t1a.txt and t1b.txt, one can use three editing commands: change line, insert line and delete line to transform one to another. In this homework, I will write a C program that takes two files as its input and output a series of commands to perform such transformation. Besides, the number of transformation commands should be as small as possible.

- ./hw12\
  In this homework, I will write a C program to solve the Travelling Salesperson Problem (TSP) via Branch and Bound.
