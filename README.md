### Brief Introduction
This responsitory contains all homework of NTHUEE Algorithms course. The purpose of uploading these homework is to record what I have learned from this course. **Any form of cheating, lying, or plagiarism will not be tolerated by professor.** Last but not least, I want to express my sincere gratitude for all the efforts Prof. Chang, Mi-Chang have taken during those days. You are really an earnest and hard-working teacher.

- ./hw01\
  In this homework, I will implement four sorting algorithms, analyze and compare their performance. The four sorting algorithms are selection sort, insertion sort, bubble sort,    and shaker sort. 
- ./hw02\
  In this homework, I will implement three kinds of primitive searching algorithms: linear search, bidirection search, random-direction search. I will also prove them and analyze their space and time complexities, then measure the average CPU time (Number of searching repetitions for a data is equal to 500) and the worst-case CPU time (Number of searching repetitions for a data is equal to 5000) of these algorithms. Finally, I will show the relation between the performance and the time complexities to see whether the time complexities I derived are correct or not. Besides, I will compare the performance between three kinds of algorithms and explain the reasons.
